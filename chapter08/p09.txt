Consider four processes with the following starting and ending times:
Process   Start Time   End Time
A         6            8
B         3            5
C         4            7
D         2            9

For each pair of processes, indicate whether they run concurrently (Y) or
not (N):

Process pair   Concurrent?
AB             N
AC             Y
AD             Y
BC             Y
BD             Y
CD             Y
