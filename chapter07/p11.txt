The program header in Figure 7.14 indicates that the data segment occupies 0x230
bytes in memory. However, only the first 0x228 bytes of these come from the
sections of the executable file. What causes this discrepancy?

The discrepancy of 8 bytes is caused by the .bss segment of an executable file. 
.bss segment does not take up any space in the file but these variables take up
space in memory
