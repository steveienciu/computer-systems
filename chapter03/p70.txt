Consider the following union declaration:
union ele {
 struct {
  long *p;
  long y;
 } e1;
 struct {
  long x;
  union ele *next;
 } e2;
};

This declaration illustrates that structures can be embedded within unions.
The following function (with some expressions omitted) operates on a linked
list having these unions as list elements:

1 void proc (union ele *up) {
2 up->__ = *(__ ) - __;
3 }

A) What are the offsets (in bytes) of the following fields:
e1.p = 0
e1.y = 8
e2.x = 0
e2.next = 8

B) How many total bytes does the structure require?

16

C) The compiler generates the following assembly code for proc:
void proc (union ele *up)
up in %rdi
proc:
 movq 8(%rdi), %rax
 movq (%rax), %rdx
 movq (%rdx), %rdx
 subq 8(%rax), %rdx
 movq %rdx, (%rdi)
 ret
On the basis of this information, fill in the missing expressions in the code
for proc.

void proc(union ele *up)
{
    up->e2.x = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up->e2.next->e1.y;
}
