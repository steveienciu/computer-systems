Given the assumptions in Problem 6.41, what percentage of writes in the following
code will hit in the cache

int *iptr = (int *)buffer;
for (; iptr < ((int *)buffer + 640 * 480); iptr++) {
    *iptr = 0;
}

Since this it working at the int level (4-bytes), we will have a hit rate of 50% since block size
is only 8-bytes long. This can still have a better performance than problem 6.42 since working at 
the int level instead of char level
