Have machine with a 1,024-byte direct-mapped data cache with 16-byte blocks.
You are given the following definitions

struct point_color {
    int c;
    int m;
    int y;
    int k;
};

struct point_color square[16][16];
int i, j;

Assume the following
- sizeof(int) = 4
- square begins at memory address 0
- The cache is initially empty
- The only memory accesses are to the entries of the array square. Variables i
and j are stored in registers

Determine the cache performance of the following code
for (i = 15; i >= 0; i--) {
    for (j = 15; j >= 0; j--) {
        square[i][j].c = 0;
        square[i][j].m = 0;
        square[i][j].y = 1;
        square[i][j].k = 0;
    }
}

A. What is the total number of writes

16*16*4=1024

B. What is the total number of writes that hit in the cache

The struct is 16 bytes long which fits inside a 16-byte block which is what we have here. Therefore, 
there are 768 wirtes that hit

C. What is the hit rate

hit rate=768/1024=75%
