Suppose we have a system with the following properties:
- memory is byte addressable 
- memory accesses are to 1-byte words
- addresses are 13 bits wide
- cache is 4-way set associative, with 4-byte block size, and eight sets

A. What is the size of this cache in bytes:

C=E*B*S=4*4*8=128 bytes

B. Indicate the fields that would be used to determine the following: CO (cach block offset),
CI (cache set index), and CT (cache tag)

CO: 0-1
CI: 2-4
CT: 8
