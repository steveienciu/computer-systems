Given the assumptions in Problem 6.41, what percentage of writes in the following
code will hit in the cache

char *cptr = (char *) buffer;
for (; cptr < (((char *) buffer) + 640 * 480 * 4); cptr++) {
    *cptr = 0;
}

Since memory access is being done sequentially with 8-byte cache block, have chache hit of 87.5%
