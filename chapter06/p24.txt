Suppose that 2 MB file consisting of 512-byte logical blocks is stored on a disk 
drive with the following characteristics
Parameter							 Value
Rotational rate						 18,000 rpm
Tavg-seek							 8 ms
Average number of sectors/tracks	 2,000
Surfaces							 4
Sector size							 512 bytes

A. Estimate the optimal time (in ms) required to read the file given
the best possible mapping of logical blocks to disk sectors (i.e., sequential)

Tavg-transfer=1/18000*1/2000*60/1=0.001ms
Tavg-rotation=1/2*1/18000*60/1=1.6ms
T=Tavg-seek+Tavg-rotation+(2MB/512)*Tavg-transfer=13.6ms

B. Estimate the time (in ms) required to read the file if blocks
are mapped randomly to disk sectors

T=(Tavg-seek+Tavg-rotation+Tavg-transfer)*(2MB/512)=38.404s
