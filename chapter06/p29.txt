Suppose have a system with the following properties:
- memory is byte addressable
- memory access are to 1-bye words
- addresses are 12 bits wide
- cache is two-way set associative, with 4-byte block size, and four sets

A. Indicate fields that would be used to determine the following: CO (cache block offset), 
CI (chache set index), and CT (cache tag)

CO: occupies bits 0-1
CI: occupies bits 2-3
CT: occupies bits 4-11

B. For each of following memory access, indicate if it will be cache hit or miss when carried out 
in sequence as listed

Operation	Address	   Hit 	   Read value
read        0x834	   miss    --
write       0x836      hit     unknown
read        0xffd      hit     0xc0
