Determine the block sizes and header values that would result from the following sequence of malloc requests. 
Assumptions: (1) The allocator maintains double-word alignment and uses an implicit free list with the block 
format from Figure 9.35. (2) Block sizes are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes

Request      Block size (decimal bytes)     Block header (hex)
malloc(2)    8                              0x9              
malloc(9)    16                             0x11
malloc(15)   24                             0x18
malloc(20)   24                             0x18

since the header takes up 4 bytes, need to add that to the total number of bytes getting allocated
to get the total block size
