Determine the minimum block size for each of the following combinations of alignment requirements and block formats. 
Assumptions: Implicit free list, zero-size payloads are not allowed, and headers and footers are stored in 4-byte words

Alignment       Allocated block           Free block             Min block size (bytes)
Signle word     Header and footer         Header and footer      12
Signle word     Header, but no footer     Header and footer      8
Double word     Header and footer         Header and footer      16
Double word     Header, but no footer     Header and footer      8

since looking for min block size, assuming that size of allocated payload is 1-byte
