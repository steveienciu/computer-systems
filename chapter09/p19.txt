You are given three groups of statements relating to memory management and garbage collection below. In each group, 
only one statement is true. Your task is to indicate which statement is true.

1. 
(a) In a buddy system, up to 50% of the space can be wasted due to internal fragmentation.
(b) The first-fit memory allocation algorithm is slower than the best-fit algorithm (on average).
(c) Deallocation using boundary tags is fast only when the list of free blocks is ordered according to increasing 
memory addresses.
(d) The buddy system suffers from internal fragmentation, but not from external fragmentation.

(a)

2. 
(a) Using the first-fit algorithm on a free list that is ordered according to decreasing block sizes results in 
low performance for allocations, but it avoids external fragmentation.
(b) For the best-fit method, the list of free blocks should be ordered according to increasing memory addresses.
(c) The best-fit method chooses the largest free block into which the requested segment fits.
(d) Using the first-fit algorithm on a free list that is ordered according to increasing block sizes is equivalent 
to using the best-fit algorithm.

(d)

3. Mark&Sweep garbage collectors are called conservative if
(a) They coalesce freed memory only when a memory request cannot be satisfied.
(b) They treat everything that looks like a pointer as a pointer.
(c) They perform garbage collection only when they run out of memory.
(d) They do not free memory blocks forming a cyclic list.A

(b)
